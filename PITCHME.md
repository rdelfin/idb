### http://nflsdb.com

---

### What did they do well?
 - Consistent UI design across the page
 - Accurate and consistent media for models
 - Logically structured catregories for NFL data

---

### What did we learn from their website?
 - Sorting by related models can be effective

---

### What can they do better?
 - Fix pagination to display all pages and stop when out
 - Fix search to extend to all data models
 - Fix filtering to and sorting (sometimes does nothing)
 - Polish UI and fix menu rendering on mobile

---

### What puzzles us about their website? 
 - "None" filter option filters out everything rather than nothing
 - The data on model pages is missing, but shows on listings
 - Reloading the page always results in 404
 - How did they end up with 7 team members?
